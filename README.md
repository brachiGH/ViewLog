windeployqt Tool (Windows)

Qt provides a tool called windeployqt that simplifies the deployment process by automatically copying necessary Qt libraries and plugins:

Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where your application executable resides.

Run windeployqt:

```console
windeployqt MediaPlayer.exe
```

> NOTE: if you get a "libstdc++-6.dll" not found or "libgcc_s_seh-1.dll" not found
>
> you can copy the missing dlls from "PATH/TO/Qt/tools/mingw*****/bin"
